## Disclaimer

This project was embarked upon and completed for educational purposes. I do not condone dishonest declaration of health information, both when health declaration was mandatory within NUS and now. Should the Covid-19 Pandemic evolve or the emergence of any other national health emergency result in NUS reinstating mandatory health declaration, this project should not be used as a form of circumventing University policy. This project and its code is strictly for educational purposes only.

Temperature Declaration portal is now deprecated with Singapore and the Universities move towards living with Covid. However, this repo will remain up as a showcase of a personal project as well as for other looking to automate certain processes.

This is not the only open source iteration of the project available. I claim no credit for the inception and originality of such an idea.

I am not liable for any misuse or ill intentions as a result of running this script.
